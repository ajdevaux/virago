VIRAGO stands for VIRAGO Interferometric Resonance Analysis for Globular Objects

The program is designed to count virus particles (virions) captured by antibodies on a silica-silicon substrate (in the form of a 10-16 mm chip). This substrate is designed to take advantage of the property of Interferometric Resonance (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferometry). Essentially, virions are too small to be seen by traditional light microscopes, so typically electron microscopy (EM) is employed to study virion morphology. EM has several drawbacks, including sample preparation and expense.

This instrument that generates the data for which is called an IRIS and was developed at Boston University in collaboration with nanoView Diagnostics.
